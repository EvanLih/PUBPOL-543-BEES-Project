<h1>Studying Sustainable Development</h1>

<p>
The main focus of this analysis is to study global trends in sustainable development. Sustainable development is essentially a way of measuring human development while taking into account ecological issues. The Sustainable Development Project, an academic research group, has created a Sustainable Development Index (SDI), which measures "the ecological efficiency of human development, recognizing that development must be achieved within planetary boundaries" (Sustainable Development Project 2015). More specifically, the SDI score divides a country's human development index by its ecological impact index (which takes into account CO2 emissions and material footprint). With this SDI measurement, the higher a country's index is, the better off that country is in terms of sustainable development.

Through this analysis, we hope to explore two main questions: 
</p>
1. How do countries’ development compare when incorporating the environment into the equation? 
    + More specifically, how does SDI’s overall measurement differ from the individual variables regarding land use, renewables, and general energy usage?
    + Does SDI accurately predict a country’s renewable capability/ resource usage/ land use?

2. How else can sustainable development be measured?
    + SDI and Land Use
    + SDI and Resource Usage
    + SDI and Resource Rent

<p>
The following analysis delves into these questions, starting with a univariate exploration, followed by a multivariate study, and finally, a spatial analysis.
