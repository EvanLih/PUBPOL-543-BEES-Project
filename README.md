# Studying Sustainable Development
## Course: PUBPOL 542: Visual Analytics

# Purpose of Analysis
Our analysis seeks to study global trends in sustainable development.

**Through this analysis, we hope to explore two main questions:** 
</p>
1. How do countriesâ development compare when incorporating the environment into the equation? 
    + More specifically, how does SDIâs overall measurement differ from the individual variables regarding land use, renewables, and general energy usage?
    + Does SDI accurately predict a countryâs renewable capability/ resource usage/ land use?

2. **How else can sustainable development be measured?**
    + SDI and Land Use
    + SDI and Resource Usage
    + SDI and Resource Rent

### What is Sustainable Development?
#### “The ecological efficiency of human development, recognizing that development must be achieved within planetary boundaries”

### WHat is the Sustainable Development Index? 
#### SDI, Sustainable Development Index, is a measure which intends to reflect the sustainable development level of a country, the higher the index it, the more sustainably developed the country is. This measure takes consumption-based CO2 emissions and material footprint into consideration.
