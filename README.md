# Purpose of Analysis
Our analysis seeks to study global trends in sustainable development.

* <a href="https://evanlih.github.io/PUBPOL-543-BEES-Project/">Final HTML/Analysis</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/EvanLih/PUBPOL-543-BEES-Project/blob/master/Final_Data.csv">Data File</a>

**Through this analysis, we hope to explore two main questions:** 
</p>
1. How do countries development compare when incorporating the environment into the equation? 
    + More specifically, how does SDI's overall measurement differ from the individual variables regarding land use, renewables, and general energy usage?
    + Does SDI accurately predict a country's renewable capability/ resource usage/ land use?

2. **How else can sustainable development be measured?**
    + SDI and Land Use
    + SDI and Resource Usage
    + SDI and Resource Rent
